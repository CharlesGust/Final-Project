        Take your web pages into the Third Dimension. Web Design has been a two dimensional domain in the past. But, that no longer needs to be the case. You can now present a whole new dimension (pun intended) of your web site with this easy to use jQuery plugin.
      </p>

      <p class="content__text">
        This may sound daunting at first. But, let us show you some examples of what can be done with various types of content by taking them into the Third Dimension. Use the navigation links in the header to see example content presented in base HTML, 2.5-D, and full 3-D.
      </p>

      <p class="content__text">
        JWorld is a JavaScript 3D kit based on CSS3 and HTML5. It can render any HTML5 elements into a 3D view and lets you control the camera and the sprites in the scene. If a camera and a scene is not wanted, there is also a "page" mode to set CSS-3D without any camera or view setup.
      </p>

      <p class="content__text">
        JWorld is available as a jQuery plugin or as a standalone version, the standalone version does not have all features that the plugin have, and is more complicated to use.With jworld it is very easy to setup 3D scenes, even with very little scripting knowledge.
